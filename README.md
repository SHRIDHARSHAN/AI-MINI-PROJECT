move.[14] There are many chess engines available to download but in this project we 
will use Beowulf chess engine that is open source. Some other open source chess 
engines include: stockfish, Gull, Protector, Minkochess, Texel, Scorpio, Crafty,

Gaviota, Prodeo and Nebula. Some commercial chess games include: Houdini, 
Rybka, Komodo, Vitruvius, Hiarcs, Chiron, Shredder, and Junior.
